whenToUse:
  - when you need a compact mental model of the repo before editing package code, generation scripts, or release automation
  - when deciding which package or automation layer owns a behavior change
  - when upstream sync, runtime assets, or release tags are mentioned without exact paths
whenToUpdate:
  - when package topology or generation flow changes
  - when new release automation makes the current map misleading
  - when stable versus generated paths move

## Repo Shape

This repo packages two SDK surfaces under one root:

- `sdks/typescript/`
- `sdks/python/`

The root owns generation, verification, tagging, and publish automation.

## Stable Vs Generated Paths

| Path group | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/ci/**` | stable generation, verify, tag, and publish helpers |
| `docs/release-setup.md` | stable release-environment contract |
| `docs/upstream-automation.md` | stable upstream-sync design contract |
| `sdks/typescript/src/**` | TypeScript package source, including generated types, schemas, and committed runtime assets |
| `sdks/typescript/scripts/**` | TypeScript generation and asset-sync helpers |
| `sdks/python/src/**` | Python SDK source and committed generated models |
| `sdks/python/scripts/**` | Python generation helpers |
| `sdks/python/tests/**` | Python SDK tests |
| `sdks/typescript/dist/**` | generated build output, useful for packaging checks but not the first edit surface |
| `sdks/python/dist/**` | generated build artifacts, useful for packaging checks but not the first edit surface |
| `sdks/python/htmlcov/**` | generated test coverage output, not a durable source path |

## Upstream Flow

The practical executable chain today is:

`tidas-tools -> tidas-sdk`

Important consequences:

- `scripts/ci/tidas-tools-assets.mjs` validates the upstream Rust asset lock and derives schema, methodology, and runtime roots from catalog entries rather than package-layout assumptions
- `scripts/ci/lib/typescript-dependencies.sh` gives clean generation and verification runs the same `npm ci --workspaces=false` dependency graph from the committed TypeScript lockfile
- TypeScript runtime assets mirror the catalog-selected non-export roots and include the exact authoritative `asset-lock.v1.json`
- Python generated models also refresh from `tidas-tools`
- `tidas` remains important for public spec/docs content, but it is not the immediate generation source for current package refreshes

## Package Responsibilities

### TypeScript package

The TypeScript package owns developer-facing APIs plus packaged runtime assets and helpers for the non-export portion of the `tidas-tools` workflow.

It also owns the stable validation contract that downstream apps consume:

- generated schemas can emit custom Zod issues for localized-text checks
- `sdks/typescript/scripts/generate-zod-schemas.ts` is responsible for preserving the custom validation-code injection during regeneration
- that generator also preserves the cross-field Flow name condition that JSON-Schema `if` / `then` cannot be represented by the intermediate TypeScript interface alone
- `sdks/typescript/src/core/config/ValidationConfig.ts` normalizes raw Zod issues into the `validationIssues` payload returned by `validateEnhanced()`
- downstream consumers should rely on normalized issue codes instead of parsing free-form error text when they need stable programmatic behavior

### Python package

The Python package owns generated SDK surfaces and validation helpers that are published separately from standalone `tidas-tools`.
Its generator consumes an explicitly resolved schema directory and preserves the
same type-aware Flow name condition in generated Pydantic models.

## Release Automation

The normal release path is:

1. verify package changes
2. merge to `main`
3. let automation create:
   - `typescript-v<version>`
   - `python-v<version>`
4. let publish workflows ship from the immutable tag after package verification

This release model is part of the repo architecture, not just a release checklist.

## Common Misreads

- `tidas` is not the immediate generation upstream for current SDK refreshes
- standalone conversion and export still belong in `tidas-tools`
- generated build outputs are not the only durable source of truth
- a merged child PR does not finish workspace delivery

## Local Docpact Push Gate

This repository has a versioned local `pre-push` hook under `.githooks/pre-push` that delegates to `scripts/docpact-gate.sh` and then runs both package verification scripts. The gate resolves the CLI through `scripts/docpact`, so local agent shells do not need bare `docpact` on `PATH`. The hook is the local guard for docpact config validation, enforced doc-governance linting, and package tests; the GitHub `CI` workflow is manual-dispatch only.
