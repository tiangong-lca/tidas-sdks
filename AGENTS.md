## Repo Contract

`tidas-sdk` owns the generated developer package surface for TIDAS: the published TypeScript package, the in-repo Python SDK, and the generation / verification / release automation that keeps them aligned with `tidas-tools`.

For the TypeScript package, that ownership now includes the machine-readable validation contract exposed by `validateEnhanced()`: downstream callers should expect a stable `validationIssues` array with normalized `code`, `path`, `severity`, optional `params`, and `rawCode`, rather than parsing raw Zod messages when stable behavior matters.

## Documentation Roles

| Document | Owns | Does not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AGENTS.md` | repo contract, branch and delivery rules, hard boundaries, minimal execution facts | full path map, proof matrix, or long setup prose |
| `.docpact/config.yaml` | machine-readable repo facts, routing intents, governed-doc rules, ownership, coverage, and freshness | explanatory prose or long-form walkthroughs |
| `docs/agents/repo-validation.md` | minimum proof by change type, upstream-resolution notes, PR validation note shape | repo contract, branch policy truth, or topology explanations |
| `docs/agents/repo-architecture.md` | compact repo shape, stable path map, upstream flow, release model, and common misreads | checklist-style proof guidance or operator setup commands |
| `docs/release-setup.md` | registry setup, release environment, trusted publishing, and release workflow prerequisites | path ownership, routing semantics, or package topology |
| `docs/upstream-automation.md` | cross-repo automation design for `tidas-tools -> tidas-sdk` refreshes | current package validation baseline or branch-policy truth |
| `README.md` | repo landing context, package overview, basic setup commands, and AI docs entry | machine-readable routing or lint semantics |

## Load Order

Read in this order:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `.docpact/config.yaml`
3. `docs/agents/repo-validation.md` or `docs/agents/repo-architecture.md`
4. `docs/upstream-automation.md` or `docs/release-setup.md` only when automation or publishing is part of the task
5. package-local docs under `sdks/typescript/**` or `sdks/python/**` only when the task is already narrowed to one package surface

## Operational Pointers

- path-level ownership, routing intents, governed-doc inventory, and lint rules live in `.docpact/config.yaml`
- minimum proof and upstream-resolution notes live in `docs/agents/repo-validation.md`
- stable path groups, upstream handoffs, and release topology live in `docs/agents/repo-architecture.md`
- repo-local documentation maintenance is enforced locally by the pre-push docpact gate; `.github/workflows/ai-doc-lint.yml` is manual-dispatch fallback
- the main routing intents are `typescript-sdk`, `validation-contract`, `python-sdk`, `generation-and-release`, `upstream-refresh`, `release-setup`, `proof`, `repo-docs`, and `root-integration`
- TypeScript validation normalization is owned by `sdks/typescript/src/core/config/ValidationConfig.ts`, while schema-level custom issue codes for generated localized-text checks are injected from `sdks/typescript/scripts/generate-zod-schemas.ts` into committed schema output under `sdks/typescript/src/schemas/**`

## Minimal Execution Facts

Keep these entry-level facts in `AGENTS.md`. Use `README.md`, `docs/agents/repo-validation.md`, and the release / automation docs for fuller detail.

- root package manager: `npm`
- routine branch base: `main`
- routine PR base: `main`
- published packages:
  - `@tiangong-lca/tidas-sdk` from `sdks/typescript/`
  - `tidas-sdk` from `sdks/python/`
- canonical verification baseline:
  - `./scripts/ci/verify-typescript-package.sh`
  - `./scripts/ci/verify-python-package.sh`
- the local pre-push hook runs docpact and then both verification scripts
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is manual-dispatch only; tag and publish workflows run release-time package verification
- upstream refresh helpers:
  - `./scripts/ci/generate-typescript-sdk.sh`
  - `./scripts/ci/generate-python-sdk.sh`
- the default upstream generation pin is the exact `tidas-tools` commit declared by `TIDAS_TOOLS_SHA`; moving branch tips are not valid generation inputs
- release tags:
  - `typescript-v<version>`
  - `python-v<version>`

## Ownership Boundaries

The authoritative path-level ownership map lives in `.docpact/config.yaml`.

At a human-readable level, this repo owns:

- `sdks/typescript/**` for the TypeScript package source, examples, runtime assets, and package-local release docs
- `sdks/typescript/src/core/config/ValidationConfig.ts` for the normalized validation issue contract returned by `validateEnhanced()`
- `sdks/python/**` for the Python SDK source, tests, schemas, and package-local release docs
- `package.json`, `scripts/ci/**`, and `.github/workflows/{ci,publish,sync-from-tidas-tools,tag-release-from-merge}.yml` for generation, verification, tagging, and publish automation
- `README.md`, `docs/agents/**`, `docs/release-setup.md`, `docs/upstream-automation.md`, `.docpact/**`, and `.github/workflows/ai-doc-lint.yml` for repo-local governance and retained docs

This repo does not own:

- standalone conversion, export, or methodology tooling behavior
- public spec/docs-site wording
- workspace integration state after merge

Route those tasks to:

- `tidas-tools` for generation upstream, runtime assets, methodologies, and standalone tooling behavior
- `tidas` for public spec/docs-site content
- `lca-workspace` for root integration after merge

## Branch And Delivery Facts

- GitHub default branch: `main`
- true daily trunk: `main`
- routine branch base: `main`
- routine PR base: `main`
- branch model: `M1`

`tidas-sdk` does not use a separate promote line. Normal implementation merges to `main`, and later workspace delivery still requires a root submodule bump when the updated SDK snapshot should ship through `lca-workspace`.

## Operational Invariants

- do not treat `tidas` as the immediate code-generation upstream when package refresh behavior actually depends on `tidas-tools`
- TypeScript runtime assets are selected and integrity-checked through the upstream Rust `assets/asset-lock.v1.json`; the committed package copy includes that authoritative lock
- TypeScript generation and verification must install generator dependencies from `sdks/typescript/package-lock.json` through the shared `npm ci --workspaces=false` helper; upstream refreshes must not fall back to `npm install`
- generated localized-text checks in the TypeScript schemas must keep emitting stable custom validation codes so downstream UIs can map them without parsing prose
- generated Flow validators must preserve the upstream type-aware name condition: Elementary flows may omit synthetic qualifiers, while Product, Waste, and Other flows require both qualifier fields
- Python generated models refresh from `tidas-tools`, not from the public docs repository
- generated build output under `sdks/typescript/dist/**`, `sdks/python/dist/**`, and `sdks/python/htmlcov/**` is useful for packaging checks but is not the first durable edit surface
- merged repo PRs here are repo-complete, not workspace-delivery complete

## Documentation Update Rules

- if a machine-readable repo fact, routing intent, or governed-doc rule changes, update `.docpact/config.yaml`
- if a human-readable repo contract, branch rule, or hard boundary changes, update `AGENTS.md`
- if proof expectations or upstream-resolution notes change, update `docs/agents/repo-validation.md`
- if repo shape, stable path groups, or upstream handoff explanations change, update `docs/agents/repo-architecture.md`
- if registry setup or trusted-publishing prerequisites change, update `docs/release-setup.md`
- if cross-repo sync design or automation responsibilities change, update `docs/upstream-automation.md`
- if landing context or basic setup commands change, update `README.md`
- do not copy the same rule into multiple docs just to make it easier to find

## Hard Boundaries

- do not treat `tidas` as the immediate generation upstream for current SDK refreshes
- do not move standalone conversion or export logic into the SDK packages
- do not treat generated output as the only durable source of truth when generation behavior changes
- do not treat a merged repo PR here as workspace-delivery complete if the root repo still needs a submodule bump

## Workspace Integration

A merged PR in `tidas-sdk` is repo-complete, not delivery-complete.

If the change must ship through the workspace:

1. merge the child PR into `tidas-sdk`
2. update the `lca-workspace` submodule pointer deliberately
3. complete any later workspace-level validation that depends on the updated SDK snapshot

## Local Docpact Push Gate

Install the versioned local hook once per checkout:

```bash
./scripts/install-git-hooks.sh
```

The `pre-push` hook runs `scripts/docpact-gate.sh`, which delegates CLI lookup to `scripts/docpact` and performs strict config validation plus enforced lint before the push leaves the machine. It then runs both package verification scripts as the local test gate. The wrapper checks `DOCPACT_BIN`, Cargo install locations, Homebrew install locations, and then `PATH`, so local agent shells should not fail only because bare `docpact` is unavailable. The default comparison base is `origin/main`. Override it for unusual stacks with `DOCPACT_BASE_REF=<ref>` or `scripts/docpact-gate.sh --base <ref>`. The gate writes its detailed report to a temporary file so normal pushes do not create `.docpact/runs/` artifacts.
